# Fortireleases Twitter Bot

This code checks the Fortinet Firmware Updates RSS feed, looks for new entries, and posts a tweet for each at https://twitter.com/fortireleases

Take this more-or-less current source and make your own Twitter bot, or do what you want with it.

You'll need your own API keys from https://developer.twitter.com
